When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\\\\r\"),a(\"code\",[e._v('xml\\\\r\\\\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\\\\r\\\\n <username>John</username>\\\\r\\\\n</xml>')]),e._v(\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn external XML entity - \"),a(\"code\",[e._v(\"xxe\")]),e._v(\", is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header.
